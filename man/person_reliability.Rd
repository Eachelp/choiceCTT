\usage{
person_reliability(
  data,
  variance_threshold = 0.1,
  relMax = NULL,
  careless_items = NULL,
  careless_response = c(3, 4, 5),
  careless_MAX = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing numeric response data.}

\item{variance_threshold}{A numeric threshold below which a variance is considered too low, suggesting uniformity in responses that may indicate carelessness.}

\item{relMax}{The maximum allowable consecutive identical responses, suggesting potential automatic or careless responding.}

\item{careless_items}{A vector of column names to check for specific careless response patterns.}

\item{careless_response}{A vector of values considered to be careless if repeated too frequently.}

\item{careless_MAX}{The maximum number of careless responses allowed before flagging.}
}
\value{
A data frame with original data analysis and additional flags for potential issues.
}
\description{
This function analyzes individual responses for signs of inconsistency or carelessness by measuring the variance, maximum run length of consecutive identical responses, and counting missing or careless responses.
